# Network-Request-Browser-Extension
A lightweight browser extension for Chrome and Edge that logs network requests in real time.

Network Request Monitor is a minimalist browser extension that captures and displays real-time HTTP requests from the current tab. It provides quick visibility into request methods, status codes, and URLs â€” perfect for debugging APIs, monitoring front-end activity, or inspecting third-party calls without opening DevTools.

Features:
-Real-time logging of network requests (XHR, fetch, script, etc.)
-Color-coded borders by HTTP method (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
-Auto-updates logs live as they happen
-Filter logs by method (live dropdown)
-Clear logs instantly
-Works on both Chrome and Microsoft Edge (Manifest V3)
